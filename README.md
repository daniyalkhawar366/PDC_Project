🔧 Parallel and Distributed Computing Project
This project implements an incremental Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm for large dynamic graphs using:

✅ Sequential Version

🚀 MPI-based Parallel Version

⚡ Hybrid MPI + OpenMP Version

The graph is dynamically updated through edge insertions and deletions, and performance is evaluated in terms of execution time and scalability.
